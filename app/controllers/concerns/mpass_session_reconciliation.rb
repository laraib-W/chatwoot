# Rule 2 — session-identity reconciliation (audit row 20).
#
# When the browser holds a session for user A but oauth2-proxy asserts user B, the
# stale session MUST be flushed before anything else happens. Chatwoot's credential
# is client-held (a devise_token_auth triple the SPA persists into the JS-readable
# cw_d_session_info cookie), so the server cannot clear it directly — hence two
# paths, both defined here so "mismatch" has exactly one definition:
#
#   Path A (DashboardController) — document requests, resolved by redirecting
#     through the handoff, which re-mints for B. RouteHelper.js:23-27 already clears
#     the previous cookie whenever the login route carries email + sso_auth_token.
#   Path B (Api::BaseController) — XHR, which cannot be redirected. Evict the
#     request's token and answer 401; the SPA's 401 handler hard-navigates.
#
# Header ABSENCE is never a mismatch. Internal traffic (Sidekiq, health probes,
# direct container hits) carries no header and must not be logged out.
#
# The same two signals answer the entry question — see mpass_handoff_required?.
# "Which user does this document belong to" is one decision, so mismatch and
# first-entry are decided here together rather than in two places that could drift.

  # session at all. Nothing on the client can start the handoff: under SSO the login
  # page offers only local credentials, so a user who has just scanned the QR code
  # would land on a login form with no way in. The server therefore starts it.
  #
  # Distinct from a mismatch, which needs a session to disagree with, and narrower
  # than "no session": without an asserted identity there is nothing to hand off,
  # which is what keeps bypass paths (header-stripped, never re-added) out of it.

  #               has already populated current_user.
  #   Document  — a browser navigation sends NO auth headers, only the
  #               cw_d_session_info cookie. DashboardController descends from
  #               ActionController::Base and never includes SetUserByToken. Devise
  #               still gives it a current_user, but that one is Warden's, read
  #               from the httpOnly Rails session the SPA cannot see or clear, so
  #               it must not count: trusting it served the app to a browser whose
  #               SPA then showed a dead-end login page (devkit e2e, 2026-09-24).
